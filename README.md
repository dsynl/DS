# SECNN
Squeeze and Excitation  convolutional neural network implementation
## Requirement
- tensorflow



## Useage
1. Unzip'AHU_data' to get AHU data set
2. Run `AHU_13.py` to training models. 
2. Unzip'chiller_data' to get the Chiller data set
3. Run `chiller.py` to training models. 

## Datasets
